# MovieIdea

## A simple manageable website with a great amount of movie suggestions 
MovieIdea can be used everytime you wanna watch a movie, 
but are unsure about which one. The site consists of a simple and lightweight user interface,
and extremly easy to use. This project had some specific topics,
which was my main focus area i was trying to address as a part of my learning journey. 
Those parts was the following:
 
 - Fetching from a external API endpoint - from TMDb in this case.
 - Develop a filter - and sorting functionality giving the user different settings availabel.
 - Handling a considerable amount of data with great perfomance.
 - Advanced DOM manipulation in terms of creating, injecting, transversing and deleting items.
 - A single DOM UI where JS is handling different states, subsites etc.
 - User navigation through keyboard interaction.
 
 ### Specifications
This site is only using the noUIslider libary to create the range slider.

No other libary - or framework was used to handle css or js.

### Thoughts
All css settings, js configuration etc. is custom coded,
and is considered as a learn-by-doing challenge. 

### Developing environment 
 - npm - as package manager
 - grunt - as task runner
 - SASS - as preprocessor
 - git - as version control system
